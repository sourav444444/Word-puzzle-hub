    <h1>How I Mastered Vocabulary and Grammar Rules Using Word Puzzle Games</h1>

    <h2>Month 1: Discovering which puzzle is the best for me</h2>
    <p>During my college days, when I decided to improve my vocabulary, I started searching for different articles on the internet. Suddenly, I saw an article where it is written that said playing word games daily can enhance vocabulary skills. So, I started discovering which word games I should start with. Some of the best word games I found on the Internet are Spelling Bee, Wordle, Scrabble, Letter Boxed, and Crossword. 
    I tried each word game and found Wordle is the right choice. The game is simple and straightforward. I played daily and noted down new words in my notebook. After giving 2-3 weeks, I was confident enough to solve the puzzle without taking the help of the dictionary.</p>

    <h2>Month 2: trying to work on my consistency</h2>
    <p>I set a goal that I would learn 10 new words daily and revise those words that I leart earlier. It helped me learn words in a consistent way. I took a word, tried to understand its context and made a sentence using them. It helped me memorize those words. At the beginning, it was very discouraging. It was very difficult to win wordle. When I started recognizing the patterns, it became easy. After a few days, winning became my habit. It encouraged me to learn more unfamiliar words. </p>

    <h2>Day 3: leveling up my studies</h2>
    <p>After 2 months, I was confident solving worldles. I decided to level up my learning. So, I went for some advanced puzzles and picked Letter Boxed. The gameplay of Letter boxed is unique than that of other puzzles. It is a box- shaped puzzle and each side contains 3 distinct letters. You are given twelve letters. You need to create meaningful words by connecting those letters in clockwise or anticlockwise direction. Make sure you use up all the letters while creating words.  I found many websites that provide daily Letter Boxed answers for free, but this website is the best for both beginners and experts. You can find <a href="https://nytletterboxedsolver.com">accurate Letter Boxed hints</a>  in the website.</p>

    <h2>Month 4: understanding grammer rules</h2>
    <p>After 3 month, I realised that I learned many words. But, I was finding difficulties in forming sentences. I exam in my weak points and realized that my grammer was not up to the mark. So, i started working on my grammer besides learning new words. I started learning various topics of grammer like adjective, adverb, gerund, etc. I used to form longer sentences using Grammerly. After practising for 2-3 weeks,  creating proper sentences became easy for me.</p>

    <h2>Final words</h2>
    <p>To be honest, I thoroughly enjoyed the learning process. It helped me learn not only new words and grammar rules but also discipline and consistency. If you want to learn new things, I would recommend that you follow my process once. It will be beneficial for you.</p>
